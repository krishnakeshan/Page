# Page - Your Computer -> Home Server

Page is an application that lets you transform your PC/Laptop (more devices coming soon), into a home server. Page-Android (this repository) is the Android client for the same.

## Getting Started

To get started simply download the [page-python](https://github.com/krishnakeshan/page-python) application onto your computer and run it. You can find instructions to run page-python in its README.

After that download Page-Android onto your Android device and follow in-app instructions to connect your device to the server created in the previous step. VOILA! You're Done!

Support for more devices and platforms will be added on a best-effort basis. Read below to see how you can help!

## Contributing

Page-Android is built with Room, LiveData and based on the MVVM architecture. I've kept the code as clean as possible and well-commented so you shouldn't have trouble understanding it.

The server implementation is currently built with Python but feel free to port it to other languages for whatever reasons you find valid.

This is an open-source project like any other and pull requests are more than welcome. If you find that you can improve the application in any way, please feel free to make your changes and create a pull request.

If you're looking to generally contribute and not sure where to start, here are some things you could work on:

- Support for iOS
- Test and develop for Windows and Linux. Although page-python should run on any platform that supports Python3 the filesystem-specific functionality needs to be tested.
- A web client so devices like TVs, etc. can access it without much hassle.
